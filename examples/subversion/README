This is a simple example showing the timecloud in action. 

This example shows the number of commits per developer in a subversion
repository. This data-set is stored in the svn-timecloud.js. The main README
explains the steps involved in the creation of this file. The html file simply
loads this dataset and displays it as a timecloud.

The utils/ directory contains the tools for manipulating the raw data into a
timecloud compliant JSON list. 

You can create a similar dataset by running:

   svn log --xml --verbose >/tmp/svn.hist

and then in the utils directory:

   ./xml2tc </tmp/svn.hist >svn-timecloud.js

Don't forget to run:

   rm /tmp/svn.hist
